h3. MailChimp API for Java

h5. About

p. mc4j is a MailChimp library build in Java intended for use within Maven-enabled Spring-based applications.  The Maven part is not mandatory, of course - feel free to download the source and build yourself the library.  The Spring part is also not mandatory, as long as you deploy the library in a container that understands the @PostConstruct@ annotation, or you manually invoke  @MailChimpService::init()@ after construction.
